Real Estate Auction App - Microservices

A Single Page Application (SPA) real-estate using Spring Boot and ReactJS. Tools such as Maven, Gradle, RabbitMQ or Docker were also used. The backend is implemented following the principles of Microservices Architecture. The app is broken down into 9 microservices, each running in its own container. Databases are also decomposed for each microservice, whether they are relational databases PostgreSQL, whether they are no-SQL MongoDB, they have each its own container. Each microservice is decoupled from the other services in system and has a unique role. Thus, Gateway Service microservices are implemented with the role of single entry point, Security Service that deals with authorization and authentication, Agency Service that deals with issues related to real estate agencies, Appointment Service with the management of appointments that can be set between agents and a customer involving a property, Auction Service that manages the auctions, Person Service manages user's public information, Property Service manages property, Chat Service facilitates communication one to one between users, Email Service that deals with sending fake emails to users.
